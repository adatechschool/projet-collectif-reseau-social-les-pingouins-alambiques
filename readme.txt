First Day : Issues installing XAMPP on Bradley and Quentin's computers but the MAMP stack worked straight away on the machines 
of Myriam and Eline.

Second Day : Finished the configuration and installation of MAMP on the machines of Quentin and Bradley. In the meantime Myriam 
and Eline had advanced on the project and had resolved several of the @todo items.

Third Day: Finished the Niveau_1 and refactored as we deemed necessary/useful.

Fourth Day : Blocked with the registration of a new entry into the database/users table. With the help of Nicolas we examined the 
server logs and discovered the error with named variables not being referenced properly after they are defined (alias and pseudo).
